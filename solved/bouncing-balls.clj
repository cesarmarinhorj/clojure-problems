;;A child plays with a ball on the nth floor of a big building the height of which is known
;;
;;(float parameter "h" in meters, h > 0) .
;;
;;He lets out the ball. The ball rebounds for example to two-thirds
;;
;;(float parameter "bounce", 0 < bounce < 1)
;;
;;of its height.
;;
;;His mother looks out of a window that is 1.5 meters from the ground
;;
;;(float parameters window < h).
;;
;;How many times will the mother see the ball either falling or bouncing in front of the window
;;
;;(return a positive integer unless conditions are not fulfilled in which case return -1) ?
;;
;;Note
;;
;;You will admit that the ball can only be seen if the height of the rebouncing ball is stricty greater than the window parameter.
;;
;;Example:
;;
;;h = 3, bounce = 0.66, window = 1.5, result is 3
;;
;;h = 3, bounce = 1, window = 1.5, result is -1
