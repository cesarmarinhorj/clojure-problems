;;A bookseller has lots of books classified in 26 categories labeled A, B, ... Z.
;;Each book has a code c of 3, 4, 5 or more capitals letters.

;;The 1st letter of a code is the capital letter of the book category.
;;In the bookseller's stocklist each code c is followed by a space
;;and by a positive integer n (int n >= 0) which indicates
;;the quantity of books of this code in stock.
;;
;;In a given stocklist all codes have the same length and all numbers have their
;;own same length (can be different from the code length).
;;
;;For example an extract of one of the stocklists could be:
;;
;;L = ["ABART 20", "CDXEF 50", "BKWRK 25", "BTSQZ 89", "DRTYM 60"].
;;In this stocklist all codes have a length of five and all numbers have a length of two.
;;
;;You will be given a stocklist (e.g. : L) and a list of categories in capital letters e.g :
;;
;;  M = ["A", "B", "C", "W"]
;;
;;and your task is to find all the books of L with codes belonging to each
;;category of M and to sum their quantity according to each category. You
;;will have first to determine the common length of the codes and the common
;;length of the quantities in L.
;;
;;For the lists L and M of example you have to return the string (in Haskell/Clojure a list of pairs):
;;
;;  (A : 20) - (B : 114) - (C : 50) - (W : 0)
;;
;;where A, B, C, W are the categories, 20 is the sum of the unique book of
;;category A, 114 the sum corresponding to "BKWRK" and "BTSQZ",
;;50 corresponding to "CDXEF" and 0 to category 'W';;since there are
;;no code beginning with W.
;;
;;If L or M are empty return string is "" (Clojure should return an empty array instead).
